$ ondevice help rsync

Copy files from/to devices using rsync

Usage:

ondevice rsync [rsync-options...]

Examples:

- ondevice rsync -av /source/path/ root@myDev:/target/path/
    copy the local /src/path to myDev's /target/path/ as root
    (and pass the -a and -v options to rsync)
- ondevice rsync me@otherDev:/etc/motd /tmp/other.motd
    copy otherDev's /etc/motd file to /tmp/other.motd (and login as 'me')

This command is only a thin wrapper around the 'rsync' client (using its '-e'
argument to make it use 'ondevice ssh' internally).
